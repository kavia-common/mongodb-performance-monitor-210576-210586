# --- MongoDB connection (backend storage: perfmon DB) ---
# Preferred (Kavia multi-container): backend auto-reads mongodb_instance/db_connection.txt when present.
# This resolves the internal mongod port correctly even if Preview exposes a different external port.
#
# Fallback: set BACKEND_MONGO_URI explicitly.
BACKEND_MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017

# Diagnostics / docs:
# - GET /api/health/mongo returns which URI source/path was used, and whether ping succeeded.

# --- Backend <-> Frontend integration ---
# Standardized frontend origin for CORS.
# (Legacy: REACT_APP_FRONTEND_URL is still supported.)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Optional: additional allowed origins (comma-separated), e.g. preview URL(s)
# CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS=https://<your-preview-host>
